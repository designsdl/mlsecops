# MLSecOps Lifecycle

## 1. Data Preparation
### Key Activities
- **Data Aggregation**: Collect raw data from multiple sources.
- **Data Wrangling**: Handle inconsistencies, missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
- **Data Labeling**: Annotate datasets securely.
- **Feature Engineering**: Generate and transform features from raw data.
- **Bias Mitigation**: Detect and address dataset biases.
- **Data Storage**: Storege of cleaned data in a data store.
- **Feature Store (Offline and Online)**: Storing data and it's features in a central store to ensures consistency between training and inference.

### Risks
1. **Data Confidentiality**: Risk of exposing sensitive data during aggregation, wrangling, and storage.
2. **Storage Security**: Unauthorized access to stored datasets.
3. **Legal Compliance**: Non-compliance with regulations like GDPR or HIPAA.
4. **Data Encoding**: Inconsistencies in the data encoding during aggregation and wrangling.
5. **Label Poisoning**: Corrupted labels during the annotation process.

### Risk Mitigation
- **Data Confidentiality**: Encrypt, anonymize and tokenize sensitive data during aggregation, wrangling, and storage.
- **Storage Security**: Implement access controls and cloud security protocols (e.g., AWS IAM roles).
- **Legal Compliance**: Use tools to analyze the data to ensure compliance with GDPR or HIPAA.
- **Data Encoding**: Encode data with a consistent and specific format during aggregation and wrangling.
- **Label Poisoning**: Establish secure workflows for data labeling to avoid label poisoning.
